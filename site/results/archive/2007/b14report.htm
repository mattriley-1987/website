    <strong>Day 2</strong> and the fleet were greeted  with a 5 &ndash; 7 knots Northerly breeze and sunshine. Race 5 and with a port bias  the fleet congregated at the pin. The boats that came out best were Performance  Rigging (Don Forster/Sean Dwyer) and Velocitek (Guy Whitby/Anna Payne). <br />
    <br />
    As the  fleet split left and right, it was all about tide and wind lanes. First to the  windward mark was Performance Rigging followed by Seavolution (Mark Barnes/Pete  Nicholson) and Blue Marine (Drew Malcolm/George Morris) with the next 5 boats  overlapped. Battle royal ensued down the run with Performance rigging holding  on by the smallest of margins from Seavolution and Ovington Boats (Chris  Turner/Phil Eltringham). <br />
    <br />
    Up the next beat Seavolution got the jump on  Performance Rigging and led from this point onwards pulling away from the fleet  over the next 2 laps. However, a real battle developed behind between  Ince&amp;Co (Mark Watts/Tim Rogers), North Sails (Nils Joliffe/Richie Bell),  758 (Tim Harrison/Johny Radcliffe) and Ovington. <br />
    <br />
    At the finish it was  Ince&amp;Co by the narrowest of margins from 758 and Ovington.<br />

    <strong>Day 3</strong> and with little wind it was  going to be a tricky one for the top four boats that all had a good chance of  winning. The fleet launched into a Northerly 4 &ndash; 6 knot breeze.<br />
<br />

    Race 7 and a large wind shift to the right split  the fleet on the first beat, 758 (Tim Harrison/Johny Radcliffe) recovering from  a bad start, having tacked off, were the first to receive it and pulled out to  a comfortable lead, crossing the fleet half way up the beat. They were being  chased down by Ince&amp;Co (Mark Watts/Tim Rogers) and Blue Marine (Drew  Malcolm/George Morris). Big losers on this one were Seavolution (Mark  Barnes/Pete Nicholson) and Ovington (Chris Turner/Phil Eltringham). With real  snakes and ladders. In the new breeze, Ince&amp;Co pulled through on the last  run to win closely followed by Blue Marine and 758. Ovington recovered to 4th  and Seavolution to 8th. MJF/North Sails (Nils Jolliffe/Richie Bell)  never recovered, finishing 18th and so ssaying goodbye to their  chance of winning the event.
