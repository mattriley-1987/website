     <h1>FAQ's</h1>
     <h5>Questions and Answers ... </h5>
     <p><span class="highlight">Is there a joining fee? </span><br />
       There is no joining fee this year. Indeed, there has been no joining fee
         at Weston Sailing Club for a number of years. We try to encourage people
      to enjoy sailing, not price them out of the sport! </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">Is there a waiting list? </span><br />
       Please <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#106;&#111;&#105;&#110;&#64;&#119;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#111;&#110;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#46;&#117;&#107;">e-mail the membership secretary</a> if
       you require info for either membership or pound space. Our facilities
       are more than adequate for our current membership and the dinghy pound
      has space for up to 350 boats. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">Can I sail at Weston without becoming a member? </span><br />
       If you don't want to commit yourself to full membership of Weston, there
         are two possibilities: <br />
       You can sail on a daily basis for &pound;10 per person per day although
       you won't be able to leave your boat at the club. <br />
       You can apply for temporary membership on a month by month basis. This
       is more expensive per month than full membership, but if you wish to sail
       for less than six months, it's worth considering. <br />
       <br />
       <span class="highlight">Can I be a member of Weston without owning a boat?</span> <br />
       You don't have to be a boat owner to enjoy sailing at WSC. We have a number
       of members who are always on the lookout for willing crews. This year,
       we are compiling a register of members willing to take new members sailing
      so we should be able to find you a sail. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">I want to delay joining WSC until later in the year. Will I still have
       to pay the full annual fees?</span> <br />
       Because our sailing calendar runs from the beginning of February right
       through to the end of December, a great deal of sailing is available to
       members who join later in the year. Nevertheless, we do recognise that
       people wish to get value for money so we start to discount membership
       from August. Members joining in August pay 5/6 of annual membership and
      pound fees, those joining in September pay 4/6, October 3/6 and so on. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">Can I sail any boat at Weston?</span> <br />
       There is no restriction on types of boats at WSC other than your ability
         to launch and recover them safely. All types of boat are currently sailed
         at the club from established classes such as Mirrors and Enterprises
         to the latest asymmetric boats such as Laser 4000 &amp; 5000, RS 700 &amp; 800
      and 49er. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">My partner and family don't sail. Will they be welcome at the club? </span><br />
       Weston Sailing Club is a friendly family club. We are always pleased to
         welcome non sailing members of your family, or friends. There is a large
         patio at the front of the club where non sailors can relax and watch
         the racing or just soak up the sun. Children can run around and play
      on the patio, foreshore or park adjacent to the clubhouse. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">Can I bring my friends to the club? </span><br />
       You are welcome to brings friends to sail at the club or just enjoy the
         facilities. However, if they are regular visitors, we would encourage
      them to become full members. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">When can I launch? </span><br />
       Because of the unique double tide in Southampton Water (more details),
         launching and recovery is always possible two hours before the first
         high water and up to four hours after. When there are spring tides,
         the water can recede 100m offshore but, during neaps, the tide sometimes
         never leaves the end of the longer of the three slipways. However, if
         you are really keen, with two or three people to help, you can launch
      and recover across the mud at any time. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">Can I use the facilities when there is no racing?</span> <br />
       Access to the dinghy pound, changing rooms and hose cupboard is always
         available provided you have a key. These are available from the membership
         secretary on payment of a &pound;10 non-returnable deposit. Hot water
         is always available for showers. However, when there is no club racing,
         the clubhouse area is locked and alarmed. Therefore you will not have
      access to the galley or bar. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">How is club racing organised? </span><br />
       Club racing is organised on a handicap basis and all results are computerised.
         There are starts for catamarans, fast and slow monohulls, with a class
         start for Optimists. Currently, monohulls with a PY of 1053 or less
         start in the fast fleet with the remainder in the slow. However, if
         you can organise enough boats of one class to race on a regular basis,
      the sailing committee will consider giving you your own start. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">Do I have to enter club racing? </span><br />
       It is a commonly held belief that Weston is only interested in members
         who race. This is not true. We welcome anyone who enjoys sailing no
         matter whether their preference is for racing or cruising. We do believe
         that the best way to improve your sailing abilities is to sail in a
         fleet with other boats and club racing gives you the ideal opportunity
      to do this. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">What safety cover is available?</span> <br />
       During club races, there is always at least one safety boat on the water.
         This is in radio contact with the Race Officer on the shore. The Race
         Officer is constantly on the lookout for boats in difficulty and will
         direct the safety boat(s) accordingly. This safety cover is available
      to all sailors in the vicinity of the club, whether racing or cruising. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">When is the galley open?</span> <br />
       The galley is open to coincide with club racing so would normally be open
      when sailing is possible. It is not available if you sail at other times. </p>
     <p><span class="highlight">Do I have to do club duties?</span> <br />
       The smooth running of most sailing clubs depends on members carrying out
         duties during the year. All members, other than Associate and Honorary
         members, are expected to participate. Duties are allocated on a rota
         basis and should not exceed four times a year. <br />
